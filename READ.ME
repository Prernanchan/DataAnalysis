Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is the initial phase of data analysis, which involves getting to know your dataset.
Key activities in EDA include data summary statistics, data visualization, and identifying patterns or anomalies.
The goal is to gain insights into the data's distribution, relationships between variables, and potential issues.


Feature Selection:
Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of relevant features (variables) for your model.
Common methods include correlation analysis, feature importance from models, and domain knowledge.
The aim is to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.


Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Techniques may include one-hot encoding, scaling, imputing missing values, and creating interaction terms.
The goal is to provide the model with more informative and relevant input data.


Model Training Using XGBoost:
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm for both classification and regression tasks.
To train an XGBoost model, you need to split your data into training and testing sets.
The model is then trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, RMSE).


Model Training Using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):
Multilayer Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network used for various machine learning tasks.
Similar to XGBoost, you need to split your data into training and testing sets.
The MLP model consists of input, hidden, and output layers, and it learns through backpropagation.
Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error (MSE).


Comparison and Evaluation:
Compare the performance of the XGBoost and MLP models using evaluation metrics.
Metrics help you determine which model performs better and whether one is more suitable for your specific problem.
Consider factors like accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency when making a choice.


Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model(s) to improve their performance.
Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameters.


Cross-Validation (Optional):
Apply cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to assess model stability and generalization performance.
This helps ensure that the model's performance is not overly influenced by the initial data split.


Final Model Selection and Deployment:
Based on the evaluation results, select the best-performing model (either XGBoost or MLP).
Deploy the chosen model to make predictions on new, unseen data in a production environment if applicable.


Documentation and Reporting:
Document the entire process, including EDA findings, feature selection rationale, feature engineering transformations, model details, and evaluation results.
Prepare a report or presentation summarizing the work and its outcomes for stakeholders or team members.
